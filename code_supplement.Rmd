```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(lme4)

spotify30k <- spotify30k[grepl("[a-zA-Z]", spotify30k$track_artist), ]

# Additional Code

### Popularity means by genre 

```{r}
spotify_popularity %>%
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    avg_popularity = mean(track_popularity, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_popularity))
```

### ANOVA Test

```{r}
anova_result <- aov(track_popularity ~ as.factor(key), data = spotify_popularity)
summary(anova_result)
```

### Mean Square Error for models 

```{r}
# Calculate predictions for each model
original_predictions <- predict(lm_model, spotify_popularity)
interaction_predictions <- predict(lm_model_interaction, spotify_popularity)
genre_predictions <- predict(lm_model_genre, spotify_popularity)

# Calculate residuals for each model
original_residuals <- spotify_popularity$track_popularity - original_predictions
interaction_residuals <- spotify_popularity$track_popularity - interaction_predictions
genre_residuals <- spotify_popularity$track_popularity - genre_predictions

# Calculate MSE for each model
original_mse <- mean(original_residuals^2)
interaction_mse <- mean(interaction_residuals^2)
genre_mse <- mean(genre_residuals^2)

# Print the MSE values
cat("MSE for Original Model:", original_mse, "\n")
cat("MSE for Interaction Model:", interaction_mse, "\n")
cat("MSE for Model with Playlist Genre:", genre_mse, "\n")
```

### Mean vs Varience for poisson 

```{r}
mean_popularity <- mean(spotify_popularity$track_popularity)
variance_popularity <- var(spotify_popularity$track_popularity)

# Print the results
cat("Mean of Track Popularity:", mean_popularity, "\n")
cat("Variance of Track Popularity:", variance_popularity, "\n")
```

### Track Artist poportion on Varience 

```{r}
spotify_popularity <- spotify_popularity %>%
  mutate(across(c(energy, valence, loudness, instrumentalness, duration_ms, danceability), scale))
# Calculate the overall variance in track_popularity
total_variance <- var(spotify_popularity$track_popularity)

# Calculate the mean popularity for each artist
artist_means <- aggregate(track_popularity ~ track_artist, data = spotify_popularity, FUN = mean)

# Calculate variance between artists
between_variance <- var(artist_means$track_popularity)

# Calculate variance within artists
within_variance <- total_variance - between_variance

# Proportion of variance explained by artist
proportion_between <- between_variance / total_variance
proportion_within <- within_variance / total_variance

# Print results
cat("Total Variance:", total_variance, "\n")
cat("Between-Artist Variance:", between_variance, "\n")
cat("Within-Artist Variance:", within_variance, "\n")
cat("Proportion of Variance Explained by Artist (Between):", proportion_between, "\n")
```

### AIC & BIC Comparison 

```{r}
AIC(lm_model, lm_model_genre, mixed_model)
BIC(lm_model, lm_model_genre, mixed_model)
```
